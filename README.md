## Insights Summary
**Executive Summary**

Between 2019 and 2022, EQL recorded **$28 million** in total sales across **108,000 orders**, achieving an **average order value of $260**. Sales growth was most pronounced in **2020**, which saw a **162% increase** over the prior year and culminated in a record **$1.2 million** in December alone. Meanwhile, 2019 represented a lower baseline, with monthly sales frequently under **$500,000**.

Across regions, **North America** dominated both sales and customer distribution, while **APAC** contributed the smallest share. The **27in 4K Gaming Monitor** emerged as the top-selling product globally, driving **$9.85 million** in revenue. Refunds averaged **5%** over the four-year span—peaking at **9%** in 2020—and loyalty program members, though initially lower in overall spend, eventually outperformed non-members in average order value and total sales from mid-2021 through late 2022. Together, these findings highlight EQL’s strong market momentum during 2020’s peak, the consistent impact of seasonality (especially holiday peaks in December), and clear opportunities for targeted growth strategies in underperforming regions and product lines.

-   **Total Sales & Order Counts**
    -   Loyalty Participants: **$10M** total; 45K orders.
    -   Non-Participants: **$17M** total; 62K orders.
    
-   **Key Trend Shift**  
	- Between **June 2021** and **September 2022**, loyalty members *surpassed* non-members in both total sales and average order value, this should be investigated to understand what happened.

    -   **EMEA**: 29%
    -   **APAC**: 13%

    -   **2020 to 2021** saw a slowdown in most regions, except for LATAM’s modest 3% increase.
    
    -   **2021 to 2022** marked a notable decline across all regions, suggesting market saturation or shifting economic conditions.
    
-   **Sales vs. Customer Growth Discrepancies**
    -   **2021** stands out, particularly in **LATAM**, where more new customers did not translate into higher revenues. In fact, sales dropped by 33% in spite of slight customer gains, suggesting an issue with conversion, pricing, or product mix.
    
## Recommendations
###  Product Strategy

-   **Expand Monitor Portfolio**
    
    The 27in 4K Gaming Monitor generated **$9.85M**—roughly **35%** of sales among the top three products—establishing it as the single highest-grossing item.
    -   **Recommendation**: Merchandising should introduce additional monitor models (varying in specs and price points) to capitalize on the consistent demand for displays. This could boost overall revenue, particularly in high-growth periods like 2020, which saw a **162%** jump in total sales over 2019.
-   **Leverage Apple’s Brand Potential**
    
    The **second- and third-best-selling** items—Apple AirPods ($7.74M) and MacBook Air ($6.30M)—together represent nearly **50%** of the top-three-product revenue. However, the Apple iPhone did not perform as strongly in certain regions.
    -   **Recommendation**: Focus on in-demand Apple lines to avoid mediocre performers. Analyze item-specific sales trends to pinpoint which new Apple releases or accessories align best with consumer preferences (e.g., AirPods Max, iPads), ensuring the right product mix for each market segment.
-   **Broaden Laptop Offerings**
    
    Laptops (MacBook Air and ThinkPad) collectively occupy two of the top four revenue spots. The average order value (AOV) across all products is **$260**, but laptops often fall into a higher price bracket, making them a key revenue driver.
    -   **Recommendation**: Introduce a wider range of laptops (gaming, ultrabooks, budget-friendly) to serve diverse customers and reduce refunds linked to mismatched specs. More robust product listings—including spec sheets, video demos, and Q&A—can also preempt unnecessary returns.
-   **Assess Bose Headphones’ Feasibility**
    
    Bose Headphones perform at the lowest revenue level across all regions. In EMEA, however, audio sales in general (e.g., AirPods, Bose) fared better relative to that region’s baseline.
    -   **Recommendation**: Before discontinuation, test region-specific promotions or offers like bundling (for example, pairing Bose Headphones with other popular products) to gauge if targeted strategies can rev up sales. If low performance persists—even in EMEA—reevaluate the cost of carrying this product.
    
   ### Regional Approach

-   **Cultivate LATAM and APAC**
    
    LATAM exhibited promising growth—especially with Samsung Webcams at a **10%** distribution share (above the 6% distribution average for that region). Meanwhile, APAC contributed fewer total sales but showed notable spikes, such as the Apple iPhone surge in August 2021.
    -   **Recommendation**: Direct more marketing and product resources to LATAM, leveraging the region’s emerging consumer base. In APAC, dig deeper into seasonal or campaign drivers (especially around August and December) that fueled notable product-specific gains.
    
-   **Bolster EMEA’s Audio Market and Lagging Webcams**
    
    EMEA generated **$2.3M** in Apple AirPods revenue and sold Bose Headphones comparatively better than other regions, revealing a preference for premium audio.
    -   **Recommendation**: Capitalize on this affinity by spotlighting headphones, earbuds, and related accessories. On the other hand, Samsung Webcam sales lag here. Product should investigate whether built-in laptop webcams or strong local competitors limit demand.
    
-   **APAC’s Seasonal Variability**

    Apple iPhone sales peaked far above APAC’s monthly average in August 2021, and Samsung Webcam sales spiked in December—but remained underwhelming the rest of the year.
	   -   **Recommendation**: Marketing and Product should pinpoint what triggered these temporary surges (for example, promotions or partnerships). Building more consistent year-round promotions could sustain demand beyond these spikes.
	   
-   **Maximize Samsung Webcam Success in LATAM**
    
    Samsung Webcams outperformed in LATAM, exceeding the average sales distribution (10% vs. 6%). In contrast, Apple AirPods and Bose Headphones remain weak, signaling brand, price barriers or strong competition.
    -   **Recommendation**: Amplify resources on successful items (Webcams) in LATAM, through ads,  bundle offers, or additional offers via customer discovery efforts. Investigate whether discounted Apple or Bose deals can gain traction, or if alternative products would better suit LATAM’s preferences.
 ### Loyalty Program Insights

-   **Investigate the Mid-2021 to Late-2022 Shift**

    Despite non-loyalty participants historically spending more per order and sales (AOV **$275** vs. **$240** for loyalty), loyalty members temporarily surpassed non-members in total sales and average order value between **June 2021 and September 2022**.
    
    -   **Recommendation**: Pinpoint the catalysts—possibly a new perks rollout, external economic factors, or targeted marketing—for this reversal. Until the underlying drivers are understood, maintain the loyalty program but hold on allocating significant new resources toward expansion.
  ### Seasonal Marketing

-   **Maintain Strong Holiday Campaigns**

    December sales consistently spike, with **December 2020** alone hitting **$1.2M**. Q4 surges also boosted overall 2020 growth to **162%** year-over-year.
    -   **Recommendation**: Maximize these holiday spikes with time-limited discounts, gift bundles, and targeted advertising. Ensure sufficient inventory of top-performing products (monitors, Apple AirPods, laptops) to handle potential surges.
-   **Offset Post-Holiday Dips**
    
    January and February show consistent drop-offs following the December peaks.
    -   **Recommendation**: Extend holiday promotions, introduce early-year “New Year” deals, or roll out loyalty-specific offers to mitigate the sales dip and potentially keep AOV closer to the holiday highs.
   ### Refund Management

-   **Address High Apple Return Rates**
    
     Apple products average around **10%** refunds, double the 5% overall rate across the four-year period (2019–2022). Laptops similarly hover at 10–12%.
    -   **Recommendation**: Product, Merchandising, and Support teams should collaborate to identify the root causes—are customers unhappy with product features, facing quality issues, or discovering better deals elsewhere? Enhanced product information, easy returns, and robust tech support may help reduce this rate.
-   **Improve Laptop Buyer Education**
    
    Laptops rank high in both revenue and refunds. Refunds may likely be due to complexity and varying customer needs.
    -   **Recommendation**: Enrich listings with detailed specs, compatibility guides, user video reviews, and “compare” features. This allows customers to self-select laptops that fit their actual usage needs, potentially bringing refunds closer to the 5% overall average.
